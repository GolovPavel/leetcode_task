# Palindrome Number

Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

Follow up: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

## Examples

Input: x = 121

Output: true

Input: x = -121

Output: false

Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

## Constraints

- -2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1
